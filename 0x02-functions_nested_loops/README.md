# functions, nested loops
project done during **Full stack software Engineering studies**
**at **ALX SCHOOL**, it aims to learn about head files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**

# Technologies
* C files are compiled using 'gcc 4.8.4'
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Testes on ALX provided sandbox ubuntu 20.04

# Files 
All the following files are programs written in C:

  Filename           || Description 

0-putchar.c          || prints putchar
1-alphabet.c         || prints the alphabet in lowercase
2-print_alphabet_x10 || prints 10 times  alphabet, in lowercase
3-islower.c          || checks for lowercase character
4-isalpha.c          || checks for alphabet character 
5-sign.c             || prints the sign of a number
6-abs.c              || computes tje absolute value of an integer
7-print_last_digit.c || prints the last digit of a number
8-24-hours.c         || prints every munite of the day 
9-times-table.c      || prints the 9 times table, starting from  0
