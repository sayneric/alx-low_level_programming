# C - Debugging 
project done during **Full stack software Engineering studies**
**at **ALX SCHOOL**, it aims to learn about, debugging,What are some methods of debugging manually, How to read the error messages in **C language**

# Technologies
* C files are compiled using 'gcc 4.8.4'
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on ALX provided sandbox ubuntu 20.04

# Files 
All the following files are programs written in C:
0-main.c, main.h         | This file must test that the function positive_or_                            negative() gives the correct output when given a                             case of 0

1-main.c                 |   To Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part ofe c                             ode that is causing the output to go into an inf                             inite loop.

2-largest _ number.c     | Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it corr                           ectly prints out the largest of three numbers, no                            matter the case.

3-print_remaining _ days.c | Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that                             the output works correctly for all dates and all                             leap years.
