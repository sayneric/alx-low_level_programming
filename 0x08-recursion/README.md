0x08-recursion

This repository contains code examples and exercises related to the concept of recursion in programming. Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
Files

The following files are included in this repository:

    0-puts_recursion.c: A C program that contains a recursive function _puts_recursion() which prints a string followed by a new line.

    1-print_rev_recursion.c: A C program that contains a recursive function _print_rev_recursion() which prints a string in reverse.

    2-strlen_recursion.c: A C program that contains a recursive function _strlen_recursion() which returns the length of a string.

    3-factorial.c: A C program that contains a recursive function factorial() which calculates the factorial of a given number.

    4-pow_recursion.c: A C program that contains a recursive function _pow_recursion() which calculates the value of x raised to the power of y.

    5-sqrt_recursion.c: A C program that contains a recursive function _sqrt_recursion() which calculates the square root of a given number.

    6-is_prime_number.c: A C program that contains a recursive function is_prime_number() which checks if a given number is prime.

    7-is_palindrome.c: A C program that contains a recursive function is_palindrome() which checks if a string is a palindrome.

    100-wildcmp.c: A C program that contains a recursive function wildcmp() which compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0.
