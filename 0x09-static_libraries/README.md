Introduction

In C programming, libraries are collections of pre-compiled code that can be reused in multiple programs. They provide a way to organize code into modules, making development more efficient and allowing for code sharing between different projects.

This repository focuses on static libraries, which are libraries that are compiled and linked with the executable at compile-time. Static libraries contain object code and are typically denoted with the .a file extension.
Static Libraries

A static library is created by archiving multiple object files into a single library file. It allows the linker to extract and link only the necessary object files from the library into the final executable.

Static libraries provide the following benefits:

    Portability: Since the library code is linked directly into the executable, the resulting program is self-contained and does not rely on external dependencies during runtime.

    Performance: Static linking can potentially lead to faster execution times as there is no need to resolve symbols at runtime or load external libraries dynamically.

    Ease of Distribution: Static libraries can be distributed as a single file, simplifying deployment and eliminating the need for users to install additional dependencies.

Usage

To use a static library in a C program, the following steps are typically involved:

    Create a Static Library: Compile the source code files into object files and archive them into a static library file using the ar command.

    Link the Library: During the compilation of the main program, specify the static library file with the -l flag to the linker.

    Include Header Files: Include the necessary header files in the program source code to access the library's functions and data.

    Compile and Build: Compile the program source code, linking it with the static library, and generate the final executable.
