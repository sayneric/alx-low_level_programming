# 0x0A-argc_argv ALX Project

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It focuses on the usage of command-line arguments in C programming using the `argc` and `argv` parameters of the `main` function.

## Description

The `0x0A-argc_argv` project consists of several C programs that demonstrate various aspects of working with command-line arguments. Each program showcases different features and techniques related to `argc` and `argv`.

The project is divided into multiple tasks, and each task corresponds to a specific C program. The programs are designed to solve specific problems or demonstrate specific concepts related to command-line argument handling.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: A program that prints the name of the executable file.
- `1-args.c`: A program that prints the number of command-line arguments passed to it.
- `2-args.c`: A program that prints all command-line arguments, one per line.
- `3-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two numbers passed as command-line arguments.
- `4-add.c`: A program that adds positive numbers passed as command-line arguments.
- `100-change.c`: A program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) by running the respective compilation commands.
4. Run the compiled programs with different command-line arguments to observe their behavior.

## Usage

Each C program in the project has its own specific usage instructions. Refer to the source code comments or documentation within each program file for detailed information on how to run and use the program.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage of some programs in the project:

1. Running the `0-whatsmyname` program:

   ```bash
   $ ./0-whatsmyname
   Output: ./0-whatsmyname

    Running the 2-args program with command-line arguments:

    bash

    $ ./2-args Hello ALX World
    Output:
    Argument 1: Hello
    Argument 2: ALX
    Argument 3: World
