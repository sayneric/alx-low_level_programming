0x0A-argc_argv

This repository contains code examples and exercises related to the ALX Software Engineering program's project on argc and argv in C programming.
Description

The 0x0A-argc_argv project focuses on understanding and utilizing command-line arguments (argc and argv) in C programming. It provides examples and exercises to improve your understanding of how to pass arguments to a program during runtime and how to handle them within your C code.
