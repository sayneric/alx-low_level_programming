0x0B. C - malloc, free
Description

This repository contains the solutions for the ALX School project on dynamic memory allocation in C, focusing on the malloc and free functions.
What is in this Repository?

This repository consists of various C files, each addressing different concepts related to dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free. The files and their descriptions are as follows:

    0-create_array.c: A function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.
    1-strdup.c: A function that duplicates a string using dynamic memory allocation.
    2-str_concat.c: A function that concatenates two strings dynamically.
    3-alloc_grid.c: A function that dynamically allocates a 2D array.
    4-free_grid.c: A function that frees a 2D array previously created by alloc_grid.
    5-argstostr.c: A function that concatenates all the arguments of a program.
    100-strtow.c: A function that splits a string into words.

Requirements

    All files are written in C and compiled with gcc.
    The code is compiled using the options -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic
