0x0B. C - malloc, free
Description

This repository contains projects related to memory allocation and management in C using the functions malloc() and free(). These functions allow for dynamic memory allocation, enabling programs to allocate and deallocate memory during runtime.
Project Files

Below is a list of the project directories and a description of their contents:
Project Directory	Description
0-create _array	Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
1-strdup	Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
2-str _concat	Write a function that concatenates two strings.
3-alloc _grid	Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
4-free_ grid	Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by the alloc _ grid function.
5-argstostr	Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
100-strtow	Write a function that splits a string into words.
How to Use

To use these functions in your own project, simply copy the desired function(s) from the appropriate project file into your source code. Be sure to include the appropriate header files and function prototypes in your program as well.

To compile any of the project files, use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <main_file.c> <function_files.c> -o <output_file>

Credits
