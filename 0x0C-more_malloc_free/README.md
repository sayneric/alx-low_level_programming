    Practice memory management in C programming

Files Description

    0-malloc_checked.c: This file contains a function malloc_checked that allocates memory using malloc. If malloc fails to allocate the required memory, the function causes the program to exit with a status value of 98.
    1-string_nconcat.c: This file contains a function string_nconcat that concatenates two strings. It concatenates n bytes from the second string to the end of the first string. If n is greater than or equal to the length of the second string, the entire second string is concatenated.
    2-calloc.c: This file contains a function _calloc that allocates memory for an array using calloc. It initializes the allocated memory with zero. It takes two parameters: the number of elements to allocate and the size of each element.
    3-array_range.c: This file contains a function array_range that creates an array of integers. The array contains all the values from the min value to the max value, inclusive
