0x0C Malloc - Free
ALX Africa

This repository contains the solutions to the projects for the 0x0C Malloc - Free module in the ALX Africa Software Engineering program. The projects are focused on memory allocation and deallocation using malloc and free functions in the C programming language.

Projects
0-create_array: This project involves creating a function that allocates and initializes an array of characters using the malloc function.

1-strdup: In this project, the task is to create a function that duplicates a string using the malloc function.

2-str_concat: The goal of this project is to create a function that concatenates two strings using the malloc function.

3-alloc_grid: This project involves creating a function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers using the malloc function.

4-free_grid: In this project, the task is to create a function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function.

5-argstostr: The goal of this project is to create a function that concatenates all the arguments of the program into a single string.7

100-strtow: This project involves creating a function that splits a string into words and returns an array of pointers to these words.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0C-malloc_free.git
Requirements
All programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.
The code should follow the Betty coding style
