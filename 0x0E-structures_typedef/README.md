0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

In this project, we will learn about structures and typedef in C programming language. We will learn how to declare structures, initialize them, access their members, and use typedef to create new types.
Files

The following files were created and used for this project:
dog.h

Header file that contains the definition of a new type struct dog and function prototypes for the following functions:

    init_dog(): function that initializes a variable of type struct dog.
    print_dog(): function that prints a struct dog.
    dog_t: typedef for the type struct dog.

1-init_dog.c

Contains the implementation of the init_dog() function that initializes a variable of type struct dog.
2-print_dog.c

Contains the implementation of the print_dog() function that prints a struct dog.
dog.h

Header file that contains the definition of a new type struct dog and function prototypes for the following functions:

    new_dog(): function that creates a new dog.
    free_dog(): function that frees a dog created by the new_dog() function.

4-new_dog.c

Contains the implementation of the new_dog() function that creates a new dog.
5-free_dog.c

Contains the implementation of the free_dog() function that frees a dog created by the new_dog() function.
