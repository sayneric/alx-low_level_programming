0x0F. C - Function Pointers
Description
The 0x0F. C - Function Pointers project is a collection of C programs that demonstrate the usage and benefits of function pointers in the C programming language. The project explores various concepts related to function pointers, such as passing functions as arguments, storing functions in arrays, and using function pointers to achieve polymorphism.

Files
The project consists of the following files:

0-print_name.c: A program that accepts a function pointer to print a name.
1-array_iterator.c: A program that executes a function on each element of an array.
2-int_index.c: A program that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h: A calculator program that performs arithmetic operations using function pointers.
function_pointers.h: A header file containing function prototypes for all the functions used in the project.
README.md: A markdown file providing an overview of the project.
