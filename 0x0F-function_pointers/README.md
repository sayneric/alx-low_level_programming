Description

This repository contains the implementation of various C functions using function pointers. The ALX project aims to provide hands-on experience with function pointers in C and enhance programming skills.

Function pointers are powerful tools in C programming that allow you to dynamically select and call functions during runtime. By using function pointers, you can create more flexible and reusable code.

The project presents a set of exercises that cover different use cases for function pointers. Each function is implemented in separate files, and a main file is provided to demonstrate the usage of these functions.
Project Details

The project is organized as follows:

    0-print_name.c: A function that prints a name using a function pointer.
    1-array_iterator.c: A function that executes a given function on each element of an array.
    2-int_index.c: A function that searches for an integer in an array using a comparison function.
    3-calc.h, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-main.c: A simple calculator implementation using function pointers for arithmetic operations.
