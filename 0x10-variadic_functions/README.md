0x10-variadic_functions ALX Project
Description

Welcome to the 0x10-variadic_functions ALX project! This project focuses on variadic functions in the C programming language. A variadic function is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments. This project introduces you to the concept of variadic functions and provides hands-on experience with their implementation.

Introduction

In this project, you will be introduced to variadic functions and their usage in the C programming language. The goal is to enhance your understanding of C functions that can take a variable number of arguments, allowing you to write flexible and robust code.
Requirements

To work on this project, you need to have a C compiler (e.g., gcc) installed on your system. Basic knowledge of the C programming language is essential, along with an understanding of function prototypes and variable argument lists.
Instructions

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the project directory.
    Implement the required functions based on the given tasks.
    Compile the C files using your C compiler.
    Test your functions thoroughly with different input scenarios.
    Make sure your code passes all the given tests.

Files

The following files are included in this project:

    0-sum_them_all.c - Function to calculate the sum of its parameters.
    1-print_numbers.c - Function to print numbers separated by a specified character.
    2-print_strings.c - Function to print strings separated by a specified character.
    3-print_all.c - Function to print various data types (char, int, float, string) using variadic arguments.
    variadic_functions.h - Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.

Usage

To use the functions implemented in this project, include the variadic_functions.h header in your C files:

c

#include "variadic_functions.h"

Then, compile your C files with the provided variadic function files:

bash

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o your_program_name

Now, you can execute your program and enjoy the power of variadic functions!
