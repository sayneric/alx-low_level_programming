0x13. C - More singly linked lists

This repository contains solutions to the tasks of the "0x13. C - More singly linked lists" project, which is part of the curriculum at ALX School.

The purpose of this project is to further enhance the understanding of singly linked lists in the C programming language. The tasks in this project build on the concepts introduced in the previous "0x12. C - Singly linked lists" project and introduce new topics such as doubly linked lists and variadic functions.
Requirements

The code in this repository is written in C and was compiled using gcc version 4.8.4. The code is intended to be compiled on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Project Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:
0. Print list

Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint _t list.
1. List length

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint _t list.
2. Add node

Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint _t list.
3. Add node at the end

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint _t list.
4. Free list

Write a function that frees a listint _t list.
5. Free

Write a function that frees a listint _t list.
6. Pop

Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint _t linked list, and returns the head node's data.
7. Get node at index

Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint _t linked list.
8. Sum list

Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint _t linked list.
9. Insert

Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
10. Delete at index

Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint _t linked list.
11. Reverse list

Write a function that reverses a listint _t linked list.
12. Print (safe version)

Write a function that prints a listint _t linked list, but can handle a loop.
13. Free (safe version)

Write a function that frees a listint _t list, but can handle a loop.
14. Find the loop

Write a function that finds the loop in a listint _t linked list.
