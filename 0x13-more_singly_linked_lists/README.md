0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists. The singly linked list is a fundamental data structure where each element, known as a node, contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
Files

Here is a list of the C files present in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

    0-print_listint.c: This program defines a function print_listint that prints all the elements of a singly linked list of integers.

    1-listint_len.c: This program defines a function listint_len that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list of integers.

    2-add_nodeint.c: This program defines a function add_nodeint that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list of integers.

    3-add_nodeint_end.c: This program defines a function add_nodeint_end that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list of integers.

    4-free_listint.c: This program defines a function free_listint that frees all the nodes of a singly linked list of integers.

    5-free_listint2.c: This program defines a function free_listint2 that frees all the nodes of a singly linked list of integers and sets the head to NULL.

    6-pop_listint.c: This program defines a function pop_listint that deletes the head node of a singly linked list of integers and returns the head node's data.

    7-get_nodeint.c: This program defines a function get_nodeint that returns the nth node of a singly linked list of integers.

    8-sum_listint.c: This program defines a function sum_listint that returns the sum of all the data (integers) stored in a singly linked list of integers.

    9-insert_nodeint.c: This program defines a function insert_nodeint that inserts a new node at a given position in a singly linked list of integers.

    10-delete_nodeint.c: This program defines a function delete_nodeint that deletes a node at a specific position in a singly linked list of integers.

    100-reverse_listint.c: This program defines a function reverse_listint that reverses a singly linked list of integers.

    101-print_listint_safe.c: This program defines a function print_listint_safe that prints a singly linked list of integers, even if it contains a loop.

    102-free_listint_safe.c: This program defines a function free_listint_safe that frees a singly linked list of integers, even if it contains a loop.

    103-find_loop.c: This program defines a function find_loop that finds the loop in a singly linked list of integers and returns the address of the node where the loop starts.
