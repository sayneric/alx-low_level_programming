0x14-bit_manipulation Project

Welcome to the 0x14-bit_manipulation project by ALX! In this project, you will explore the fascinating world of bit manipulation in the C programming language. Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits within a byte (8 bits) to achieve specific goals, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or extracting bits. This project will help you understand the importance of bitwise operations and how they can be used for various tasks.

Project Description

The 0x14-bit_manipulation project is designed to help you grasp the concepts of bit manipulation in C. You will be working with various bitwise operations, such as shifting, masking, setting, clearing, and toggling bits. The project consists of a series of tasks, each focused on a different aspect of bit manipulation.
Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the project repository from the ALX GitHub organization:

bash

git clone https://github.com/alx-projects/0x14-bit_manipulation.git

Files and Functions

The project contains several C files, each corresponding to a different task. Each file contains a set of functions related to the specific bit manipulation task. Here are some of the important files:

    0-binary_to_uint.c: Convert a binary number to an unsigned int.
    1-print_binary.c: Print the binary representation of an unsigned int.
    2-get_bit.c: Get the value of a bit at a given index.
    3-set_bit.c: Set the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
    4-clear_bit.c: Set the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
    5-flip_bits.c: Determine the number of bits to flip to convert one number to another.

Feel free to explore each file to understand the functions implemented for each task.
Usage

Each C file in the project directory corresponds to a specific bit manipulation task. You can compile these files individually using your preferred C compiler.

For example, to compile 0-binary_to_uint.c, you can use:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-binary_to_uint.c -o binary_to_uint

After compiling, you can run the executable:

bash

./binary_to_uint

Follow a similar process for other tasks as well.
Compilation

The project may contain a compilation script (such as compile_all.sh) that allows you to compile all the C files at once. Make sure to check the repository for any provided compilation scripts.
